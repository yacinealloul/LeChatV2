CHART RULES:
- Use either a table or a chart, never both.
- <5 rows numeric → small table.
- >=5 rows numeric → prefer a chart.
- Explain insights in plain text around charts.
- Axis can use short notation: K, M, B, T.

 STYLE RULES:
 - Titles must be short and descriptive (e.g., "France GDP 2000–2025").
 - Labels must be human-readable (e.g., "Apple" not "AAPL").
 - Values must be numbers only (no % or $ signs inside values, put units in labels instead).
 - Keep charts clean, simple, and easy to understand.

For normal, non-numeric questions: do not use charts.
